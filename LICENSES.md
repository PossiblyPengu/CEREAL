## PlayStation Remote Play (chiaki-ng)

The integrated PlayStation Remote Play support using `chiaki-ng` has been
removed from this repository. If you need to re-add PlayStation support later,
follow the original project instructions for embedding or bundling `chiaki-ng`.

Previously bundled components and patches were removed to simplify the
repository and avoid distributing large third-party binaries.
